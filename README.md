# Homework_1



Completed the wrong homework that was uploaded on canvas ( I don't know why: but my piazza notifications were going to my junk mail). I attached the wrong hw pdf anyways so if there is time to go over that would be great! Started the right homework a little late so I wasn't able to completely finish the last question. Had trouble actually validating the statecharts in python.
